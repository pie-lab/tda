<p><u>To cite these data:</u></p>
<p>[add data paper reference here]</p>
<p>The primary goal of this project was to identify the <em>average</em> &quot;difficulty&quot; of 2,818 trait descriptive adjectives (TDAs) in American English. Difficulty, in this usage, denotes the extent to which people in our sample correctly matched the personality-relevant definition for each adjective to the adjective itself when presented as one of six options. The other five options presented as choices were randomly sampled from the remaining 2,817 adjectives in the set. To control for inevitable error resulting from similarity between distractor choices and the matching definition-adjective pair, each TDA was administered twice, with two different sets of distractor sets. On this page, we report the total number of responses and the average proportion correct across both forms.</p>
<p>In our view, the total proportion correct reflects <em>both</em> familiarity of the adjective and consensus among raters about its meaning, especially as a descriptor of personality. For example, most of the terms with a low proportion of correct responses are unfamiliar to many individuals (i.e., rarely encountered in everyday language) -- &quot;goatish&quot; (.07), &quot;pithy&quot; (.10), &quot;splenetic&quot; (.10). Other terms -- &quot;dizzying&quot; (.04), &quot;smooth&quot; (.09) -- are familiar but ambiguous in meaning relative to personality. By contrast, terms with the highest proportion of correct responses are familiar <em>and</em> unambiguous -- &quot;jolly&quot; (1.00), &quot;thankful&quot; (1.00), &quot;unreliable&quot; (.99). When using ratings of terms such as these to evaluate the structure of personality, it's important to consider the extent to which each term is known to raters and consistently interpreted.</p>
<p>Statistics from the individual administrations of each term (i.e., each version or &quot;form&quot;) can be found <a href="https://pie-lab.github.io/tda/item-difficulty.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The data can be downloaded <a href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5T80PF">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then, for reference and subsequent use in other personality projects, we sought to characterize these terms in several additional ways. To evaluate the frequency of usage for each term, there are at least two good options. One is to use the <a href="https://www.wordfrequency.info/100k.asp">Corpus of Contemporary American English</a> (&quot;COCA&quot;) and the second is to use data openly available from the <a href="http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html">Google Books</a> project. Though extremely useful, the COCA resource is proprietary so it is not possible to post the frequency of term usage based on this list. The Google Books data is less complete (and has been documented to be problematic in several respects) but publicly accessible. The &quot;GBooks frequency&quot; column below reflects z-scores based on frequency among the first 58,600 or so terms. See this post on <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/161478/what-website-will-give-me-the-frequency-of-a-word-in-the-english-language">StackExchange</a> for more information and attribution.</p>
<p>The three remaining columns reflect the inclusion or exclusion of each term in 3 previously reported sets of trait-descriptive adjectives. Many similar sets could also be included but these three were chosen based on prominence in the psycholexical study of English terms. The columns are dummy coded &quot;1&quot; for inclusion and &quot;0&quot; for exclusion in each set. The sets are the 1,710 terms of Goldberg &amp; Norman (as described <a href="https://projects.ori.org/lrg/PDFs_papers/AcetoZombie.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.48.1.26">here</a>), the 435 terms of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-0984(199603)10:1%3C61::AID-PER246%3E3.0.CO;2-D">Saucier &amp; Goldberg (1996)</a>, and the 100 terms of the Big Five Factor Markers (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/1040-3590.4.1.26">Goldberg, 1992</a>).
