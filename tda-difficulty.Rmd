We present here the difficulty of nearly 2,900 trait descriptive adjectives, each assessed using two different, randomly-generated definition-term items. For each item, we report the total number of responses across both forms of the item, as well as the total proportion correct. 

Individual item statistic can be found [here](https://pie-lab.github.io/tda/item-difficulty.html).


```{r, include = F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, message = F, warning = F)
```

```{r}
library(here) # for engaging with working environment
library(tidyverse) # for data cleaning and manipulation
library(Hmisc) # for weighted means
library(DT) # for viewing data tables

load(here("data/item_prop.Rdata"))
```

```{r, results = 'asis'}
item_prop %>%
  group_by(answer) %>%
  mutate(weight = N/sum(N)) %>%
  summarise(
    N = sum(N),
    prop = wtd.mean(prop_correct, weights = weight, na.rm=T)
  ) %>%
  mutate(prop = round(prop, 2)) %>%
  DT::datatable(
    colnames = c("Adjective", "N (total)", "Proportion Correct"), 
    filter = "top", 
    rownames = F
  )
```
